# IDS-ML
Personal work on testing various machine learning algorithms for efficiency and accuracy when implemented as an intrusion detection system


*Review 1* - Survey Paper on Adaboost<br>
*Review 2* - Implementation of Adaboost on train_test_IOT_Weather and train_test_network<br>
*Review 3* - Implementation of Adaboost on train_test_IOT_Modbus and train_test_IOT_GPS_Tracker<br>
And comparisions between results achieved by the algorithms
